# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener's unreliability in reflecting real-time authentication changes.  The bug can manifest as the UI not updating correctly when a user logs in or logs out, especially under less-than-ideal network conditions.

## Bug Description:
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener sometimes fails to trigger when the user's authentication status changes.  This could be due to network connectivity issues or unexpected behavior within the Firebase SDK.

## Solution:
The provided solution implements error handling and a more robust approach to tracking the authentication status using the `onAuthStateChanged` listener, checking for network conditions, and implementing retry mechanisms for better reliability. 

## Setup:
1. Install Firebase dependencies: `npm install firebase`
2. Configure your Firebase project and obtain your configuration data.
3. Replace placeholder values in `authBug.js` and `authSolution.js` with your Firebase configuration.
4. Run the app and observe the behavior.
